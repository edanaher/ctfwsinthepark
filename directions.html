<h1>Directions</h1>

<p>Golden Gate Park is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=golden+gate+park&amp;sll=37.768544,-122.45872&amp;sspn=0.021169,0.035577&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.769052,-122.483525&amp;spn=0.021169,0.035577&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A">this place</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the park is fairly sizable and we will be playing in a relatively small area of it. See the map below:</p>

<h2>Coming from Caltrain</h2>

<p>Walk up King to Market. Take the 5 bus outbound to 25th and Fulton then follow the map above.</p>

<h2>Coming by car</h2>

<p>There is parking along JFK drive and also on the streets north of the park. Other than that, Google is your friend.</p>
