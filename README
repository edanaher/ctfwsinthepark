This is the web site for [http://www.ctfwsinthepark.org].

It was hosted on the wonderful [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) until DDoS attacks forced them to [change their pricing](https://blog.nearlyfreespeech.net/2017/09/25/significant-pricing-updates-are-coming-soon), and it didn't seem worth the extra cost given that I have a perfectly good VPS through [prgmr.com].

So now the site's hosted on github, and I'm using some [configution](https://github.com/edanaher/nixos-config/tree/master/services/ctfwsinthepark.nix) on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) config to pull from here and serve it.
