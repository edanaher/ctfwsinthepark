<h2>WHAT</h2>

<p>Capture the Flag ... with STUFF ... in Golden Gate Park. Stuff? What do you mean stuff? Fashionable felt belts, exciting foam wands, and more. See the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> page for more information.</p>

<h2>WHEN</h2>

<p>August 3, 2013, from 2pm until it gets too dark or we get too tired. Each game is an hour and fifteen minutes, so it's okay to leave early or arrive late, but we recommend against it.</p>

<h2>WHERE</h2>

<p>Golden Gate Park! <a href="directions.html">Hellman Hollow Meadow</a> (formerly known as Speedway Meadow)</a>.</p>

<h2>WHO</h2>

<p>You! Your friends! Your facebook friends! People you dragged over from the street! Random passersby shanghaid into playing!</p>

<h2>WHY</h2>

<p>Because it's been too long since you held someone's hand while skipping and singing yankee doodle.</p>
